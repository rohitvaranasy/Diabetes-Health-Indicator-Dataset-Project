# Diabetes Health Indicator Dataset Project

## Overview

This project utilizes the Diabetes Health Indicators Dataset available on Kaggle, which can be accessed [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/alexteboul/diabetes-health-indicators-dataset/data). The goal is to analyze the dataset and explore potential correlations between various risk factors and the likelihood of a patient developing diabetes in the future.

The Jupyter Notebook included in this repository contains the code for analysis of the Diabetes Health Indicators Dataset. It encompasses the following key aspects:

- Exploring and visualizing the dataset to gain insights into the distribution of variables and potential relationships.
- Building and evaluating machine learning models to predict the likelihood of diabetes based on risk factors such as physical activity, diet, and other health indicators.
- Testing a range of machine learning algorithms, including logistic regression, decision trees, random forests, and even more advanced techniques like stacking classifiers.
- Conducting feature importance analysis to identify the most significant variables contributing to the prediction of diabetes risk.

## Dataset Information

The Diabetes Health Indicators Dataset contains comprehensive health-related information collected from individuals, including demographic details, lifestyle factors, medical history, and diagnostic measurements. It serves as a valuable resource for understanding the complex interplay between various factors and the risk of developing diabetes.

## Usage

To replicate the analysis and explore the code, follow these steps:

- Clone this repository to your local machine.
- Download the Diabetes Health Indicators Dataset from the Kaggle link provided above and place it in the appropriate directory.
- Open the Jupyter Notebook and execute the cells sequentially to perform EDA, model training, evaluation, and feature importance analysis.
